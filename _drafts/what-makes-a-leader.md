- these are my perspective, my could be incomplete, if so, I might write a follow up post in the future with more experience
  - pls email if there is any counter thoughts, all views welcome

- A wise leader & a talent team 
- The organization takes the DNA of the leader
- Leaders come in all form and shapes
- Archetypes 
  - Product first + Business = Steve Jobs of Apple
  - Designer first + Business = Brian Chesky of AirBnB
  - Business first + Product = Sam Altman of OpenAI
  - Business first + Product = Jeff Bezos of Amazon
  - Engineer first + Product = Elon Musk of Tesla, SpaceX & more
  - Engineer first + Business = Sridhar Vembu of Zoho
  - Engineer first + Business = Bill Gates of Microsoft

- For ever prototypical archetype, there are a 1000 such samples in Fortune 100, 1000 & the remaining Unfortune rest, doing the same thing

- Archetypes are less interesting than the rest to learn from, because their success is statistically improbable, 10 out of 5-7 Billion people in a 4 Billion history of humanity

- Org is a N-ary team, leader at each level exhibits this character, if root, there is potential to be a great company
- If this leader at any interim level, they keep the sub-tree happy from that level (say N/2 to leaf level)
- Some VC notices this and they get pulled out to start a company to become the root

- Silicon Valley has near perfected the art of building critical organizationals, it's amazing

- Common failure modes
  - early stage : 
    - thinking management as a special discipline
      - inexperience founders without management experience, could end up doing this, under the stress of running a startup
        - end up hiring external managers, purely for management, the problem is managers come in many forms, pure project management without engineering experience, is a drag on the company, totally upto the wisdom of the leader or founder
    - creating tiger teams or exclusive a-teams
      - creates a divide or class in the org, with default implication that rest or majority are not a-teams
    - product management overpowers engineering
      - risk of great engineers leaving, I personally found my way to tell is see if your org uses "engineering empowerment" verbally, if so run away if you are a great engineer
    - engineering overpowers product management
      - this results in poor product experience, unless there is someone who is naturally good in product, this is rare case
      - depends on the leader, this is usually a failure mode, unless the leader can pull the rest, have seen it happen once in my career
        - but this is rare, probably not healthy for the organization due to key man risk and does not scale if its your startup, as you 
        would prefer to be that person and you won't have the bandwidth to do this, while running a company

  - growth stage: 
    - being over ambitious, chewing more than you could either due to ambition or by nature of being a VC funded company with high business growth expectation
      - this is a reasonable environment for young engineers, unmarried no kids, if the person picked up the necessary engineering or coding skills before
      - a death wish for the rest, including midlevel engineers or people with family, work life balance suffers and you don't have enough contunity or room to perfect your craft
      - also good environment for managers to gain "on-fire" management experience
      - great for product manager! 

- my known hack to get humble
  - failure in life, the school of hard knocks
  - getting married with a kid
  - if someone says humility a run, observe if they are humble, usually folks who are humble are too busy in my observation, to even say anything, check if they are a wannabe, taking dependency on wannabes are dangerous from my personal experience, but that's one way to grow faster, through the failures


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
