title:  "My perspective on what makes a leader!"

- these are my perspective, my could be incomplete, if so, I might write a follow up post in the future with more experience
  - pls email if there is any counter thoughts, all views welcome

- we cover these topics in this blog, because I believe these are small invisible, incosequential pebbles that comes in our way and endup becoming a roadblock to build complex systems

- so much a note to self than others

- A wise leader & a talent team 
- The organization takes the DNA of the leader
- Leaders come in all form and shapes
- Archetypes 
  - Product first + Business = Steve Jobs of Apple
  - Designer first + Business = Brian Chesky of AirBnB
  - Business first + Product = Sam Altman of OpenAI
  - Business first + Product = Jeff Bezos of Amazon
  - Engineer first + Product = Elon Musk of Tesla, SpaceX & more
  - Engineer first + Business = Sridhar Vembu of Zoho
  - Engineer first + Business = Bill Gates of Microsoft
  - Strategy first + Cricket = Dhoni of Cricket
  - Strategy first + Politics = your top politicians or Prime Ministers or Presidents

- I am personally extrapolating from the above observation that the recepie for leadership is
  - Acknowledge that it comes in every form and shape
  - Organization takes the DNA of the leader
  - It takes at least 3 components that I know of to form a leader
    - Mindset of giving than receiving, probably in-born (i think this is rare) or shaped by life (i think this is common)
    - A core insight, a special secret sauce, that a leader realizes and hones consciously (like the secret tricks of a magacian)
    - A core skill, a technical skill, inclination in a chosen discipline, that they advance consciously over a period of time

- Another realizatio of mine is listen to Jeff recently formulate success at the the top as follows, but I think it's true and timeless for leaders at all levels
  - Jeff Bezos reformulated founder net worth as tracking value created for others, instead of value captured for self
  - Once again a genius stroke of clarity, I have not heard from other top leaders, and got me thinking
    - I think this is generally true of life itself, when we behave with our loved ones, say our spouse, kid or parents, we are this way naturally, when it comes to others we are the opposite, probably a folly of human nature
    - Leaders just realize this and right the wrong, live normally and the capitalistic system identifies this behavior or mindset change and rewards them with some brownie points (money), if certain other tactical procedures are followed such as building startups to sell or rising through the career ladder

- For ever prototypical archetype, there are a 1000 such samples in Fortune 100, 1000 & the remaining Unfortune rest, doing the same thing

- Archetypes are less interesting than the rest to learn from, because their success is statistically improbable, 10 out of 5-7 Billion people in a 4 Billion history of humanity

- Org is a N-ary team, leader at each level exhibits this character, if root, there is potential to be a great company
- If this leader at any interim level, they keep the sub-tree happy from that level (say N/2 to leaf level)
- Some VC notices this and they get pulled out to start a company to become the root

- Silicon Valley has near perfected the art of building critical organizationals, it's amazing

- Common failure modes
  - early stage : 
    - thinking management as a special discipline
      - inexperience founders without management experience, could end up doing this, under the stress of running a startup
        - end up hiring external managers, purely for management, the problem is managers come in many forms, pure project management without engineering experience, is a drag on the company, totally upto the wisdom of the leader or founder
    - creating tiger teams or exclusive a-teams
      - creates a divide or class in the org, with default implication that rest or majority are not a-teams
    - product management overpowers engineering
      - risk of great engineers leaving, I personally found my way to tell is see if your org uses "engineering empowerment" verbally, if so run away if you are a great engineer
    - engineering overpowers product management
      - this results in poor product experience, unless there is someone who is naturally good in product, this is rare case
      - depends on the leader, this is usually a failure mode, unless the leader can pull the rest, have seen it happen once in my career
        - but this is rare, probably not healthy for the organization due to key man risk and does not scale if its your startup, as you 
        would prefer to be that person and you won't have the bandwidth to do this, while running a company

  - growth stage: 
    - being over ambitious, chewing more than you could either due to ambition or by nature of being a VC funded company with high business growth expectation
      - this is a reasonable environment for young engineers, unmarried no kids, if the person picked up the necessary engineering or coding skills before
      - a death wish for the rest, including midlevel engineers or people with family, work life balance suffers and you don't have enough contunity or room to perfect your craft
      - also good environment for managers to gain "on-fire" management experience
      - great for product manager! 

- my known hack to get humble
  - failure in life, the school of hard knocks
  - getting married with a kid
  - if someone says humility a run, observe if they are humble, usually folks who are humble are too busy in my observation, to even say anything, check if they are a wannabe, taking dependency on wannabes are dangerous from my personal experience, but that's one way to grow faster, through the failures


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
