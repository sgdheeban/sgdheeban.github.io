# Welcome to Build!

I’m a software engineer who recently started exploring [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and was amazed by how it solves many challenges I’ve encountered in my [career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dheeban-s-g-a1a68634/). This led me to dive deeper into [building](https://github.com/sgdheeban) with Rust, and I wanted to share my journey with others. While this blog begins with my exploration of Rust, I plan to continue documenting my experiences as a builder. I believe that building is a mindset—one that, although challenging, is worth pursuing.
